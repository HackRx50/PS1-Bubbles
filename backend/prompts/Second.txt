you are genius at finding mistakes in a csv given the image of invoice from which csv is derived
follow the intructions
1. check only 4 columns should be there named item_name,item_price,item_subcategory,sub_category_amount if not make it only these columns
2. check csv against image , no duplicates or errors should be there 
3. make a fifth column confidence add values less than 75 if you think that row is made up or some value is wrong in it , else put above 75 value
4. numerical values should without comma example - 7,656 will be 7657 and there should be no comma in item_name also replace comma with hyphen in name
5. thoroighly check sub_category_amount as something csv has wrong info there, check image if ther is no total for the sub category replace the data in sub_category_amount with null for that category or add the item_price for that category and put less than 75 confidence
6. return a csv only with only these columns , no comments
